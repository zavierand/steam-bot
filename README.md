# SAMMY
Sammy is a simple discord bot that notifies you when games go on sale! This read me is the documentation of the bot along with how to use it.

## Commands
`$help` - displays all the available commands that can be used with Sammy.

`$hi` - Sammy will say hi back!

`$ping` - Let Sammy know you're ready to ask for assistance

`$sale -<count>` - *still in production* Sammy will tell you what games from your Steam library are currently on sale. Count flag tells Sammy the number of games from your current wishlist that you want to return (it will return just the first <count> specified in the wishlist currenlty.)

## API Usage
Sammy was built in NodeJS with discord.js. The use of the public Steam API was required for me to be able to fetch user wishlists. Future API usage includes other online markets to be able to retrieve more than just Steam games (PSN, Epic Games, etc.)

# Demo
No demo yet - lol; since the bot is still in developement. Demo section will be updated when the bot is deployed and released.
